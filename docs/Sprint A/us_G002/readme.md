# US G002 - As Project Manager, I want the team to use the defined project repository (i.e., GitHub) and setup a tool for project management.

## 1. Context

In this US, it's essential for our team to maintain a Git repository to facilitate the sharing of project files among team members as well as with our teachers.


## 2. Requirements

The team is required to accept the GitHub repository that has already been assigned and proceed with setting it up for use throughout the project.


## 3. Analysis

We will adhere to the instructions provided by the teacher on Moodle and during online classes to join the repository.

## 4. Design

### 4.1. Realization

1. To initiate work with the GitHub repository, our team accessed the link provided by the professor.
2. Each team member selected their respective ISEP student number.
3. The initial team member entered the group number and clicked "Create Team", while others simply chose the team and joined it.
4. Subsequently, all team members gained access to the repository.
5. After that, a setup tool was created for project management. Inside Github, we created a project board and added the tasks to it.
6. The team members were then able to access the project board and view the tasks assigned to them. 
7. The team members were able to move the tasks to the "In Progress" and "Done" columns as they progressed through the project.
8. The team members were able to create issues and link them to the project board.
9. Inside IntelliJ, when a commit was made, the issue number was added to the commit message, which automatically linked the commit to the issue in GitHub.


### 4.2. Tests

To test that the project board was correctly set up, we added to the commit message the issue number that was created in GitHub. This allowed us to verify that the commit was linked to the issue.
