-> FROM SPECIFICATION:

• 1002 As Customer Manager, I want to register a job opening. – Priority: 1
– References: Alternatively this can be achieved by a bootstrap process


-> Bussiness Rules:

    Job openings (or job vacancies) are created in the system by a customer manager. A job opening includes:

• Job Reference A unique identifier of the job opening (generated by the system, for instance based on the customer code followed by a sequential number)
• Title or function Such as "front end programmer"
• Contract Type Such as full-time or part-time
• Mode Such as remote, hybrid, onsite
• Address Address for job
• Company Customer name
• Number of vacancies
• Description
• Requirements

    Requirement Specifications and Interview Models:

Job vacancies (job openings) must include a Job Requirement Specification. This represents a set of application requirements that the applicants must achieve. For instance, we could de- fine a job requirement specification named "front end junior programmer", were candidates must have at least 2 years of experience, a degree in computer science or similar program, and knowledge in, at least, one of the following programming languages: java, javascript, type- script. Usually this information can be collected from the curriculum vitae of the candidate.
Interviews are a very important tool for the evaluation of candidates. Interviews should be based on a set of pre-defined questions. Interview Models, as the name implies, are sequences of questions that can be used to register the answers of candidates during interviews.
Both job requirement specifications and interview models follow the same usage. A software engineer, with great competences in language engineering, following directions from customer
managers, designs and implements modules that are dynamically added to the system. These modules contain the implementation of job requirements specification or interview models. These modules should be able to implement the necessary functionalities from processing job requirements or interviews.

A job requirement specification module should:

• Generate a template text file with the requirements to be evaluated and the possible answers for each requirement
• Evaluate if a text file with the requirements for a particular candidate is syntactically correct
• Evaluate a text file with the requirements for a particular candidate and provide the result, approved or rejected, and in case of rejection, include justification

An interview model module should:

• Generate a template text file with the questions to be asked in the interview and the possible answers for each question
• Evaluateifatextfilewiththequestionsandanswersforaparticularcandidateinterview is syntactically correct
• Evaluate a text file with the questions and answers for a particular candidate interview and provide a numeric grade for that interview
.
Figure 2.2 illustrates an example of a template text file with requirements for a job opening. In this example, the evaluation of this requirements (with the existing values) could result in a rejection since the candidate has no degree. The system should provide a justification, such as "A minimum Bachelor degree is required for the job position.". A similar approach is used for job interviews, but in this case, the goal is not to approve or reject a candidate but to evaluate the answers and calculate a grade for the interview in the range 1-100.
A job interview is a form with a set of questions. Each question as a value associated. The sum of the values for all the questions should be 100. At least the following type of questions should be supported:


• True/False A question with only a true or false answer.
• ShortTextAnswer A question with a short text answer.The limit of the answer should be the specified by a regular expression.
• Choice, with Single-Answer A question with a set of choices where only one can be selected
• Choice, with Multiple-Answer A question with a set of choices where many can be selected
• Integer Number A question which answer is an integer number
• Decimal Number A question which answer is a decimal number
• Date A question which answer is a date
• Time A question which answer is a time
• Numeric Scale A question which answer is one option in a range of integers (ex: 1-5)
According to the answers given in the interview for each question the value of the question is calculate following evaluation rules. For instance, consider the following question, which value is 10:
What programing language should be used for system XPTO?
1. Java
2. C#
3. PHP
4. Javascript
5. Typescript
For this case one could define the following rules used in the evaluation of the grade for the question:
1. If the answer is 4 and 5 then 100%
2. if the answer is 4 then 40%
3. if the answer is 5 then 80%
In this case, if the answer is 1 and 2 the grade is 0% of 10, therefore 0. If the answer is 4, the grade is 40% of 10, therefore 4. The total grade of an interview is the sum of the grade of all the questions.
